As it runs on almost every currently available mobile phone (you need Chinese character support though) you can take your personal Chinese trainer wherever you go.

As the name suggests, ZDT²go is based on [ZDT](http://zdt.sourceforge.net/), implementing ZDT's **flashcard self-review feature on mobile phones**. Therefore, its main purpose is to allow users of ZDT to take their flashcards with them.

# ZDT #
If you are not a user of [ZDT](http://zdt.sourceforge.net/) yet, why not give it a try? ZDT provides you with intensive functions to **quickly** create vocabulary lessons (as it has integrated dictionaries) and has **different modes** to help you studying Chinese vocabulary.

# Installation #
See [Installation](Installation.md) for instructions on how to get started with ZDT²go on your mobile phone.
